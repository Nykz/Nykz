### Senior Full-Stack Engineer | AI Systems Architect | Educator

I design and build **production-grade systems** across web, mobile, and AI.

Founder of **Coding Technyks**.  
I help developers move from tutorial-driven coding to **real-world engineering** by focusing on architecture, system design, and decision-making, not just syntax.

## What I Do

- Architect **scalable full-stack applications**
- Build **cross-platform mobile systems** used in real products
- Design **agentic AI systems** using RAG, MCP, and tool-based orchestration
- Teach developers **how engineers think**, not just how frameworks work

Writing code is common.  
Designing systems is not.

## Core Focus Areas

### Frontend and Mobile Architecture
- Angular for large-scale, maintainable applications
- Ionic for production-ready cross-platform mobile apps
- React where it fits the system

### Backend and System Design
- Node.js for scalable backend services
- API-driven system architecture
- Authentication, data access, and service boundaries designed for growth
- Clean, modular backend structures

### Agentic AI and Intelligent Systems
- Agentic AI architecture
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Tool orchestration, memory layers, and system control flows
- OpenAI and Gemini-based systems

### Data and Infrastructure
- Relational data modeling with PostgreSQL
- NoSQL where appropriate
- Cloud-ready backend design
- Real-time systems using managed platforms

## Engineering Philosophy

- Frameworks change. Systems last.
- AI does not replace engineers. It exposes weak ones.
- Clean architecture beats clever code.
